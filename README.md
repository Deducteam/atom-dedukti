## Installation

You need atom-ide-ui, to install it, run :

```
$ apm install atom-ide-ui
```

### Installing the Dedukti Language Server:

`dedukti-editor` needs a language server for Dedukti. The easiest method is to use the [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager:
```bash
$ opam switch 4.06.1
$ opam repository add deducteam https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/anonscm/git/opam-deducteam/opam-deducteam.git
$ eval `opam config env`
$ opam install ocamlfind ocamlbuild bindlib earley earley-ocaml
$ opam install lambdapi-lsp
```

In case the installation doesn't work, don't forget to update your packages :
```bash
$ opam update 
$ opam upgrade
```
